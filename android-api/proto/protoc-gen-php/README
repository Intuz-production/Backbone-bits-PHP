This is a PHP Google Protocol Buffer Generator Plugin for protoc. It generates PHP code from a .proto file.

It's not finished, but supports most common features, and I'm currently using it in a production system.

I've only tested the code on Debian Linux. To build just type "make". You may need the following libraries which can be installed from apt:

libprotobuf-dev
libprotobuf-lite6
libprotobuf6
libprotoc-dev
libprotoc6

Once compiled you can use it via protoc like so:

 protoc -I. -I/usr/include --php_out . --plugin=protoc-gen-php=./protoc-gen-php your.proto

This should generate the file "your.proto.php", which should be able to encode and decode protocol buffer messages. When using the generated PHP code you must include the "protocolbuffers.inc.php" file.

There are many TODOs to finish, for example writing better documentation :)
